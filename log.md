# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Got some good work done on the Neural Network application. I programmed all of the dynamically generated visuals and completed the integration of the softmax function.

**Thoughts**: When I first looked at the softmax equation it looked like a big jumble of unrecognizable math. Tons of symbols I've never seen and things that seemed just superfluous. After some digging into it a bit more I realized that the equation was much more simple than I had originally made it out to be.

### Day 2: June 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created methods to get and set weights for the entire neural network. Also made a kickass validation function for the setWeights function.

**Thoughts**: The getWeights function was about as easy to code as I expected it to be. The setWeights took much longer because of the validation code needed but I am glad I wrote it and proud of the validation code. I had to triple nest an ArrayList in order to maintain the program as completely dynamic; I'm left wondering if I could've done a better job and actually used an array instead but since the code works, that's a problem for another day.
