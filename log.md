# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Got some good work done on the Neural Network application. I programmed all of the dynamically generated visuals and completed the integration of the softmax function.

**Thoughts**: When I first looked at the softmax equation it looked like a big jumble of unrecognizable math. Tons of symbols I've never seen and things that seemed just superfluous. After some digging into it a bit more I realized that the equation was much more simple than I had originally made it out to be.
