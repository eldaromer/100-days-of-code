# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Got some good work done on the Neural Network application. I programmed all of the dynamically generated visuals and completed the integration of the softmax function.

**Thoughts**: When I first looked at the softmax equation it looked like a big jumble of unrecognizable math. Tons of symbols I've never seen and things that seemed just superfluous. After some digging into it a bit more I realized that the equation was much more simple than I had originally made it out to be.

### Day 2: June 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created methods to get and set weights for the entire neural network. Also made a kickass validation function for the setWeights function.

**Thoughts**: The getWeights function was about as easy to code as I expected it to be. The setWeights took much longer because of the validation code needed but I am glad I wrote it and proud of the validation code. I had to triple nest an ArrayList in order to maintain the program as completely dynamic; I'm left wondering if I could've done a better job and actually used an array instead but since the code works, that's a problem for another day.

### Day 3: June 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today was mostly spent reading up on the math behind the back propogation and the adjustment behind the weights. Not much code was written.

**Thoughts**: Not only did I not actually write any code but I also forgot to update this log, this will be my one mess up day but I must make sure to get in time where I actually code for an hour.

### Day 4: June 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started a new project today on suggestion by a friend in order to buff out my web development portfolio. I will be writing code for a secure password validation component but will also be coding the surrounding architecture to accomodate it.

**Thoughts**: Forgot to update the log again, this is not the right way to manage this but I am learning from my failures in maintaining this in order to better maintain it in the future.

### Day 5: June 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Most of the time today was spent looking through my code and trying to figure out why it isn't working. Lots of googling and lots of code tweaking but the app finally works, next task is to start writing the logic for the component itself.

**Thoughts**: Today was incredibly frustrating. To spend so long and to find that my error came from one tiny, simple mistake is one of the worst aspects of coding. Only when programming can there be such an intense emotion derived from a superfluous pair of square brackets. I'm glad I perservered and fixed the program as it will make my life much easier for the future.
